Rockâ€“Paperâ€“Scissors ðŸŽ®

This is a simple Python program that simulates a **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game between the user and the computer.

## How It Works

- **Get the user's choice**: the player inputs their move
- **Generate a random choice for the computer**
- **Determine the winner** based on the classic rules:
  - Rock beats Scissors
  - Scissors beats Paper
  - Paper beats Rock
